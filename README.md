# Pulseboard
Real-Time Pluggable Data Dashboard -- Pulseboard is a web-first, real-time dashboard platform that lets users monitor arbitrary data feeds (system metrics, repo stats, financial prices, IoT sensors, etc.) via a modern browser UI. It is designed to run both locally (offline-first, via localhost) and as a deployed web application.
